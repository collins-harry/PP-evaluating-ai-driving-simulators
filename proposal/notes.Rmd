An over-reliance on data-driven models for decision-making in complex systems is risky; their key deficiency is the scarcity of observations during crisis times. This makes them fragile under the definition prescribed by Nicholas Taleb:
“Anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile.”
In other words, when exposed to previously unseen events, data-driven models tend to do worse than when history is repeating itself.

Simulation’s key advantage over data-driven methods is that it allows us to forecast things that have never happened before and to run scenarios outside of historical bounds — including crisis scenarios.
